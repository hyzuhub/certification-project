			<p>The King was the King right from the start. Neither has the King's movement changed. In variants such as Chinese Chess and others from South East Asia, the piece is a General.</p>

			<p>In Shatranj, a variant bridging Chaturanga and western chess, there was no stalemate rule. If the King can't move and there is no other move, then even if he is not in check, it's said to be checkmate.</p>

			<p>There is no castling in Shatranj. Taking all of your opponents pieces apart from the bare King is a win unless he can take your last piece apart from the King on the next move. That's a draw.</p>

			<p>The Europeans introduced castling to make it possible to get the King safe in the new, speeded up version. They said that a King must be under attack to be in checkmate. If he was not the result would be a draw by stalemate. They also decided that a bare King was not defeated and had to be checkmated.</p>

			<p>When a player threatens the opposing King with capture, the King is said to be in check.</p>

			<p>If your King is in check then you must avert its capture or you lose the game immediately. It is illegal to leave your King in check. To alleviate the threat:</p>

			<ol class="textL" style="text-align:left">
				<li>
					<p>Move the King to a square not commanded by your opponent's pieces</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Capture the attacking piece</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Block the check by moving one of your pieces between the attacking piece and your King</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

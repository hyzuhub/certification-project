			<p>The pawn moves only forward to the other end of the board. The Knight moves in an L-shaped fashion. You may also find the Knight Tour interesting.</p>

			<p>The Bishop's move gives it maximum range on the diagonals. The Rook's move gives it maximum range on the straights.</p>

			<p>The Queen's move gives her maximum range on the files, ranks or diagonals on which she stands. The King moves just like the Queen except instead of enjoying maximum range he is restricted to minimum range. He can move only one square at a time in any direction.</p>

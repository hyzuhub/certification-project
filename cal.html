			<p>The Knights represented the cavalry on the chessboard. The distinctive move is unchanged since the piece was invented. The Knight like the cavalry doesn't charge directly at the enemy. As it moves in it veers to one side in an effort to outflank the opposing forces. This is where the Knight's movement comes from.</p>

			<p>Some people say the Knight ended up with this move because the Knight starts between a Rook and a Bishop. It moves one square orthogonally like a Rook and continues one square diagonally like a Bishop.</p>

			<p>Other people say that it's because all other conceivable movements were taken already. It was the only movement remaining. Along with it's ability to jump all blockades, with it's distinctive movement, it is pretty hard to imagine chess without the Knight. Maybe that's why it's movement was never changed. Don't mess with perfection.</p>

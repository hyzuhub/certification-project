		<p>A brief history of chess pieces. Pieces of varying power and value. Natural selection in a way. Gradual modifications and improvements to the original game until we reached the present status quo. We now have a fantastic strategy game. How would you improve it? Hard to say really.</p>
		<p>Computers can show the best moves and continuations for any opening known to man. And yet the possibilities remain infinite. The nature of the game is that each move produces numerous possible continuations. Every door has several more doors waiting behind it.</p>
		<p>We've had a quick glance at each of the pieces in turn. Now we can look back on European chess from it's foundations to the modern day. Early on there wasn't too much heed paid to defensive considerations. It was a race to checkmate as players would go for the throat right from the start. Some beautiful combinations were played in what came to be known as the Romantic Era.</p>

			<p>When the Indians developed chess they modeled it on their army. Each piece represented an arm of the military. The pawns were styled on the infantry on the front line. Not much changed as the Europeans saw them in a similar light.</p>

			<p>The pawn represented a foot soldier or a common peasant. For this reason the pawns line up on the front line. It only marches forward, is used to hold the line and like cannon fodder is often sacrificed for a higher purpose. The Europeans quickened it by allowing 2 squares on the first move to speed up the game.</p>

			<p>Maybe promotion represents the little guy's dream to a tee. Work hard, fight like a tiger, survive the odds and maybe you can move up in the world.</p>

			<p>The term Rook is taken from the Persian word rukh which means chariot. In the ancient armies of India and later Persia, the chariots were used for their lightning speed on the battlefield.</p>

			<p>In other places that later adopted chess, such as Russia, the chariot became a fast boat. It was always represented by something powerful and dynamic.</p>

			<p>The Persian chariot resembled a small mobile castle due to the stonework on its sides. When chess came to Europe, the Europeans took this to be a castle or tower of some kind.</p>

			<p>The Persian word rukh even sounded like rocca, the Italian word for fortress. The piece became a castle referred to in English as the Rook. The German word for it is Turm meaning Tower.</p>

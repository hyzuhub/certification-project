			<p>The Queen changed probably more than any other piece in the game. In India in the 6th Century this piece was a male Advisor (Vizier), not a Queen. The King and the Vizier would watch the battle from a vantage point. They would send instructions to the troops in the field.</p>
		
			<p>The Vizier was weak, able to move only one square diagonally in any direction. When the game moved to Europe this piece became a Queen as they were commonplace in just about every European country.</p>
	
			<p>In the Middle Ages, the Europeans introduced a raft of rule changes to speed up the game. They enhanced the power of a number of pieces.</p>
		
			<p>Due to the influence of Queen Isabella of Spain circa 1475, the Queen was empowered dramatically. Her movement was amended to what it is today, unlimited range on the ranks, files and diagonals making her the strongest piece in the game.</p>

		<br>
		<hr>
		</div>
		<div class="text" style="line-height:1em">
			<p>The right to claim the draw belongs exclusively to the player:</p>

			<ol class="textL" style="text-align:left">
				<li>
					<p>Who is about to play a move leading to such a repetition of the position</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Who is about to reply to a move that has produced the repeated position</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>If you move without claiming a draw in the manner described in 1. or 2. you lose the right to claim a draw. This right is restored to you, however, if the same position appears again, you again having the move.</p>
			<p>If pieces of the same kind and of the same color occupy the same squares, but the possibilities for moving these pieces are not the same, then the player moving cannot claim a draw.</p>
			<p>For example, you would no longer be entitled to demand a draw if, after the repetition of a position, castling or taking a pawn "en passant"
			was no longer possible.</p>
			<p>You may draw if you show while moving that at least fifty consecutive moves have been made by each side with no capture of any piece or the movement of any pawn.</p>
			<p>You may only propose a draw when you have just completed a move. You start your opponents clock after the request, not before. Your opponent may accept the draw or, either orally or by completing a move, he may reject it. In the meantime you cannot withdraw it.</p>

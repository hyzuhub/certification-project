			<div class="textBlock2"><p> The diagram on the left shows the initial set-up to start a game. Both players start with 16 pieces. Some people do not regard the pawns as pieces. <br>
			<br>They would say you start with 8 pieces on the back row and 8 pawns in front. The pieces for both sides are: A King, Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops and 8 pawns.<br><br>The pieces start (in algebraic chess notation form) as follows:White Rooks: a1,h1; Black Rooks: a8,h8; White Knights: b1,g1; Black Knights: b8,g8; White Bishops: c1,f1; Black Bishops: c8,f8; White Queen: d1; Black Queen: d8; White King: e1; Black King: e8. White pawns: a2,b2,c2,d2,e2,f2,g2,h2; Black pawns: a7,b7,c7,d7,e7,f7,g7,h7.</p></div>

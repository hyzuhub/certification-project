			<p>Apart from castling, you make moves by moving one of your pieces from one square to another square. The destination square on a given move must be either vacant or occupied by one of your opponent's pieces.</p>

			<p>Only the Knight may cross a square occupied by another piece. The only possible exception to this rule is the special castling move between King and Rook.</p>

			<p>You capture an enemy piece by moving one of your pieces to a square occupied by your opponent's piece. On capturing, you immediately remove your opponent's piece from the chess board.</p>

			<p>The various pieces have their own unique movements. For a crash course on the main rules you can take a look at the chess basics.</p>

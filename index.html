			<p>Welcome and make yourself at home. Time to learn the great game of chess. Or to improve the skills you already have. You may be an amateur player who likes to play chess as a hobby. You might be a club player who plays tournaments over the board.</p>

			<p>But you want to improve. The key is making the learning process fun. Then you'll always be hungry for more growth.</p>
